🌾 Karshika Sakhi – AI-Powered Personal Farming Assistant

A Digital Companion for Kerala’s Smallholder Farmers

📌 Overview

Kerala’s smallholder farmers often struggle to access personalized, timely agricultural advice. Most available advisories are generic and fail to consider crucial local factors such as crop type, soil conditions, weather fluctuations, and individual farming practices.
Additionally, farmers rarely maintain structured records of their activities, which limits their ability to track progress, learn from previous seasons, and access government schemes.

Krishi Sakhi aims to bridge this gap by providing an intelligent, contextual, and easy-to-use digital assistant tailored to every farmer’s unique environment.

🌱 Problem Statement

Farmers lack personalized advisory based on real-time local factors.

Generic guidelines ignore specific crop needs, soil type, or micro-climate.

Many farmers don’t record daily activities, affecting learning and eligibility for schemes.

Limited access to localized data on pest outbreaks, best practices, and soil health.

🎯 Objective

Build an AI-powered personal farming assistant that acts like a friendly digital companion for each farmer—
learning continuously, guiding proactively, and supporting decision-making throughout the crop cycle.

🚀 Core Features
1. Farmer & Farm Profiling

Collect essential details to build a personalized context:

Location

Land size

Crop selection

Soil type

Irrigation source

Input usage pattern

2. Conversational Interface (Malayalam)

Supports voice and text.

Simple, friendly, and easy-to-understand responses.

Built for users with low digital literacy.

3. Activity Tracking

Farmers can log farm events in natural language:

“Rain expected tomorrow—avoid pesticide spraying.”

“Whitefly infestations reported nearby. Check your brinjal crop.”

“Apply irrigation today due to high temperature forecast.”

5. Reminders & Alerts

Timely nudges on:

Crop operations

Pest/disease risk

Government scheme deadlines

Local market price trends

6. Knowledge Engine
